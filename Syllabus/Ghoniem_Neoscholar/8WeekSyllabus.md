# Course Overview and Objectives

The Renewable Energy course provides introductory-level tutorials on the
conversion principles and technologies in various clean energy sources,
such as solar, wind, hydro, biomass, and geothermal. We examine the
issues involved in the thermodynamics, design and operation of three
main systems: solar, biomass, and hydro-power during the first four
weeks of the class. We also discuss the integration of various clean
energy sources and their economics. The second part of the class (last
four weeks) will be dedicated to enhancing the research experience of
students, where three or more groups will conduct independent research
under my supervision. At the completion of this course you will be able
to:

-   Understand the principles of operation of several clean energy
    technologies.

-   Analyze the \"system\" aspects of clean energy technologies.

-   Realize the technical and economic challenges of each system.

-   Learn the fundamental principles of thermodynamic energy conversion.

-   Learn research tools and write a report on the design, operation,
    integration, or economics of a selected system.

Examples of research projects are: design & operation of solar-thermal
power plants; Physics of solar-voltaic systems; Current research and
developments in solar photovoltaic materials and systems; design of
energy storage systems; material selection in solar, hydro, biomass,
wind, or ocean system; design & operation of wind, ocean, or biomass
system; integration & economics of renewable energy systems. Several
research tools will be taught to participating students during the
second half of the class. These include: (i) technical writing of
reports and papers; (ii) research sources and references; (iii) data
representations and graphics.

Students are expected to spend three hours per week with the instructor,
and an additional 3-4 hours per week on homework assignments and
research projects.

# Project Description

Renewable energy sources are important in two respects: (1) they can be
sustainable for long periods; and (2) they are carbon-free or have
low-carbon emissions. Nevertheless, many technologies are still emerging
and are in the process of intense development. There are many
constraints that affect the rapid development and introduction of
renewable energy sources. These are mainly economic, but some
limitations are also related to the society and its acceptance of such
technologies. The world will need many professionals with a deep
knowledge of renewable energy technologies. Key to such expertise is
understanding the underlying physical and technological principles,
their economics and market needs, their environmental impact, and the
likelihood that they can be integrated within existing energy grids,
especially within the concept of \"smart grids.\"

In this project, a team of students will develop a concept report that
addresses one particular renewable energy source, and make a
presentation of their findings at the end of the course. The guidelines
for the project, associated report, and group presentation are:

1.  Select a renewable energy source, and develop a research plan. The
    energy source may be from the following list.

    -   Heat pumps.

    -   Rooftop solar thermal water heater.

    -   Domestic solar heating systems.

    -   Active solar heating and design of solar collectors.

    -   Passive solar heating of residential and commercial building.

    -   Solar thermal engines, power plants and electricity generation.

    -   Solar photovoltaics: physics & technology.

    -   Large, grid-connected Solar photovoltaic power plants.

    -   Biomass resources.

    -   Bioenergy conversion technologies.

    -   Hydroelectric power plants.

    -   Tidal energy technologies: barrages, lagoons, & streams.

    -   Electric power from wind energy.

    -   Wave energy technology.

    -   Deep geothermal energy.

2.  Make an outline for your project and final report. Your outline may
    include some of the following:

    -   Introduction

    -   History

    -   Physics & technology principles

    -   Description of a typical system, engine, or power plant.

    -   Integration in energy grid.

    -   Environmental impact

    -   Economics

    -   Future developments

    -   Conclusions

    -   References

    -   Appendices

3.  Perform research on the topic in consultation with the Teaching
    Assistant and your team members.

4.  Divide up the report writing tasks amongst team members.

5.  Prepare the project report as a collaborative effort with
    participation of all team members. The report is expected to be
    between 15-20 pages long.

6.  prepare a power point presentation to the class, to be given the
    last day of instruction.

7.  A few short lectures will continue throughout week 7 of the class to
    cover materials from earlier weeks.
