# Course Overview and Objectives

The Renewable Energy course provides introductory-level tutorials on the
conversion principles and technologies in various clean energy sources,
such as solar, wind, hydro, biomass, and geothermal. We examine the
issues involved in the thermodynamics, design, and operation of three
main systems: solar, biomass, and hydro-power. We also discuss the
integration of various clean energy sources and their economics. The
project is dedicated to enhancing the research experience of students,
where three or more groups will conduct independent research under my
supervision. At the completion of this course, you will be able to:

-   Understand the principles of operation of several clean energy
    technologies.

-   Analyze the \"system\" aspects of clean energy technologies.

-   Realize the technical and economic challenges of each system.

-   Learn the fundamental principles of thermodynamic energy conversion.

-   Learn research tools and write a report on the design, operation,
    integration, or economics of a selected system.

Students are expected to spend 120 minutes every two weeks with the
instructor and an additional 1-2 hours per week on research and code
development.

**Research Project**: A team project will require students to work
together on a feasibility study for a renewable energy development
project at a location of their choice using the technologies and tools
presented in this class. More details will be provided during the
course. The TA will direct the project, and students are expected to do
a final presentation. The professor will give short tutorials on
research methodology and tools. These will include Python code
programming and resources (optional), writing a good research paper,
using Overleaf and other latex typesetting software for professional
report writing, and using Google Scholar and ChatGPT as research
assistants.

# Research Projects

## Photovoltaic Solar Cell Technology

Silicon-based solar cell technology is a cornerstone of modern renewable
energy systems, providing an efficient and sustainable means to harness
solar energy. This project invites undergraduate students to explore the
key principles and applications of silicon photovoltaics. Students will
gain insights into the photoelectric effect, bandgap energy, and
spectral absorption properties that underlie the conversion of sunlight
into electricity.

The project will also explore the manufacturing processes of silicon
solar cells, examining techniques such as wafer production, doping, and
anti-reflective coatings. A focus will be placed on evaluating
efficiency improvements through advanced designs like passivated emitter
rear contact (PERC) cells.

Beyond theoretical knowledge, students will use Python to simulate the
Shockley-Queisser efficiency limit for silicon-based cells. The
simulator will allow them to calculate and visualize the efficiency as a
function of material properties and environmental conditions. The
results will include solar spectrum utilization and recommendations for
optimizing cell designs.

The project further explores the economic and environmental implications
of solar technology, including cost trends, government incentives, and
lifecycle emissions. By the end of the project, students will have a
comprehensive understanding of silicon-based solar cell technology and
its pivotal role in the transition to sustainable energy systems.

##  Design of a Hydro Power Plant

Hydropower remains one of the most reliable and sustainable forms of
renewable energy, offering opportunities for small-scale applications to
supplement local energy demands. This project focuses on the design and
analysis of a small-scale hydroelectric power plant using Python-based
simulations. Students will begin with a review of the literature to
understand the principles of hydropower, including types of plants,
turbine technologies, and their environmental and economic implications.

The project progresses to site analysis, where students will evaluate
key parameters such as river flow rates, head, and seasonal variability.
Using a Python code base, they will simulate plant performance,
calculate power output, and analyze economic feasibility, including
capital costs, annual revenue, and payback periods. Seasonal variations
in flow will also be modeled to ensure a robust design.

In addition, students will compare their proposed design with real-world
case studies, highlighting the trade-offs between efficiency, cost, and
environmental impact. The project ends with a detailed report and
presentation summarizing the methodology, results, and recommendations.

This project equips students with practical skills in engineering
analysis, Python programming, and renewable energy system design,
fostering an understanding of sustainable development in the energy
sector.
