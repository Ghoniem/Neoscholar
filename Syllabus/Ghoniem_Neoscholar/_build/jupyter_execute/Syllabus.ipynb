    "\n",
    "The Renewable Energy course provides introductory-level tutorials on\n",
    "conversion principles and technologies in various renewable energy sources,\n",
    "such as solar, wind, hydro, biomass, and geothermal. We examine the\n",
    "issues involved in the thermodynamics, design, and operation of three\n",
    "main systems: solar, biomass, and hydropower. We also discuss the integration of various renewable energy\n",
    "sources and their economics. At the completion of this course you will\n",
    "be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Understand the principles of operation of several clean energy\n",
    "    technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Analyze the \"system\" aspects of clean energy technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Realize the technical and economic challenges of each system.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Learn the fundamental principles of thermodynamic energy conversion.\n",
