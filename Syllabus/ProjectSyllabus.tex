\section{Course Overview and Objectives}
The Renewable Energy course provides introductory-level tutorials on the 
conversion principles and technologies in various clean energy sources, such as solar, wind, hydro, biomass, and geothermal. We examine the issues involved in the thermodynamics, design, and operation of three main systems: solar, biomass, and hydro-power. We also discuss the integration of various clean energy sources and their economics. The project is dedicated to enhancing the research experience of students, where three or more groups will conduct independent research under my supervision. At the completion of this course, you will be able to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Understand the principles of operation of several clean energy technologies.
    \item Analyze the "system" aspects of clean energy technologies.
     \item Realize the technical and economic challenges of each system.
    \item Learn the fundamental principles of thermodynamic energy conversion.
    \item Learn research tools and write a report on the design, operation, integration, or economics of a selected system.
\end{itemize}


Students are expected to spend 120 minutes every two weeks with the instructor and an additional 1-2 hours per week on research and code development.

\textbf{Research Project}: A team project will require students to work together on a feasibility study for a renewable energy development project at a location of their choice using the technologies and tools presented in this class. More details will be provided during the course. The TA will direct the project, and students are expected to do a final presentation. The professor will give short tutorials on research methodology and tools.  These will include Python code programming and resources (optional), writing a good research paper, using Overleaf and other latex typesetting software for professional report writing, and using Google Scholar and ChatGPT as research assistants.

    \section{Research Projects}
\subsection{Photovoltaic Solar Cell Technology}

Silicon-based solar cell technology is a cornerstone of modern renewable energy systems, providing an efficient and sustainable means to harness solar energy. This project invites undergraduate students to explore the key principles and applications of silicon photovoltaics. Students will gain insights into the photoelectric effect, bandgap energy, and spectral absorption properties that underlie the conversion of sunlight into electricity. 

The project will also explore the manufacturing processes of silicon solar cells, examining techniques such as wafer production, doping, and anti-reflective coatings. A focus will be placed on evaluating efficiency improvements through advanced designs like passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) cells.

Beyond theoretical knowledge, students will use Python to simulate the Shockley-Queisser efficiency limit for silicon-based cells. The simulator will allow them to calculate and visualize the efficiency as a function of material properties and environmental conditions. The results will include solar spectrum utilization and recommendations for optimizing cell designs.

The project further explores the economic and environmental implications of solar technology, including cost trends, government incentives, and lifecycle emissions. By the end of the project, students will have a comprehensive understanding of silicon-based solar cell technology and its pivotal role in the transition to sustainable energy systems.

\subsection{The Organic Rankine Cycle in Renewable Energy}

The organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) is a crucial technology in the renewable energy sector, offering a pathway to harness low-grade heat sources for sustainable power generation. This undergraduate project focuses on understanding and simulating the ORC, emphasizing its thermodynamic principles, applications, and environmental benefits. Students will explore the selection of organic working fluids, analyze real-world applications such as geothermal and solar power plants, and evaluate the economic feasibility of ORC systems. 

A significant component of the project involves programming in Python to calculate thermodynamic properties, visualize T-S and H-S diagrams, and determine efficiency and power flows using tools like CoolProp. In addition, students will examine the environmental impacts of ORCs, discussing their role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and using waste heat effectively.

\subsection{ Design of a Hydro Power Plant}

Hydropower remains one of the most reliable and sustainable forms of renewable energy, offering opportunities for small-scale applications to supplement local energy demands. This project focuses on the design and analysis of a small-scale hydroelectric power plant using Python-based simulations. Students will begin with a review of the literature to understand the principles of hydropower, including types of plants, turbine technologies, and their environmental and economic implications.

The project progresses to site analysis, where students will evaluate key parameters such as river flow rates, head, and seasonal variability. Using a Python code base, they will simulate plant performance, calculate power output, and analyze economic feasibility, including capital costs, annual revenue, and payback periods. Seasonal variations in flow will also be modeled to ensure a robust design.

In addition, students will compare their proposed design with real-world case studies, highlighting the trade-offs between efficiency, cost, and environmental impact. The project ends with a detailed report and presentation summarizing the methodology, results, and recommendations.

This project equips students with practical skills in engineering analysis, Python programming, and renewable energy system design, fostering an understanding of sustainable development in the energy sector.
